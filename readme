🧠 Querying & Optimization

CRUD: Insert, Upsert (onConflict) 

✅ Joins – Master innerJoin, leftJoin, rightJoin, and fullJoin with aliases. ✅

🔁 Subqueries – Use .where(sql${subquery}) and build complex expressions.

📐 Views – Use PostgreSQL views with Drizzle and treat them like read-only tables.

🔀 Transactions – Learn db.transaction() for safe, atomic multi-step ops. ✅

📊 Indexing – Understand B-tree, GIN, and partial indexes; use .sql to define them.

🚀 Raw SQL with Drizzle – Use sql`...`.execute() for advanced queries and window functions.
